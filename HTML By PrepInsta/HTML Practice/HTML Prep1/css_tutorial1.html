        <p><h3>CSS or Casecading Style Sheet</h3></p>

        <p><b>CSS:</b> It is a stylesheet language used to describe the look and formatting of a document written in HTML.</p>
        <p><ul>CSS allows you to control the appearance of webpages by specifying styles for elements, such as colors, fonts, layouts, and spacing</ul></p>
        <p><ul>CSS rules consist of two main components: <b>Selectors</b> and <b>Declarations</ul></b></p>
        <p>
            <ul><ul><b>i. Selectors:</b> Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements</ul></ul>
            <ul><ul><b>ii. Deselectors:</b> While declarations define the styles to be applied to those elements.</ul></ul>

            <li><b>Notes:</b>
                    A declaration consists of a property (the aspect of the element being styled) 
                    and a value (the specific style to apply). CSS rules are enclosed within curly
                    braces ({}) and are usually placed in a separate CSS file or within the <"style"> 
                    element in an HTML document.
            </li>

        </p>

        <p>
            <h4><li>Here's an example of a simple CSS rule:</li></h4>
            <p>
                The selector p targets all <"p"> (paragraph) elements in the HTML document. 
                The declarations within the curly braces define the styles to be applied 
                to the targeted elements. The color property sets the text color to blue, 
                the font-size property sets the font size to 16 pixels, and the text-align 
                property centers the text within the paragraph element.
            </p>
        </p>

            <h4>CSS Style Methods</h4>
            CSS can be applied to HTML documents in three different ways. Each method has its own use cases and advantages. They are:
            <ul>1. Inline Style</ul>
            <ul>2. Internal Style</ul>
            <ul>3. External Style</ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            <h4>1. Inline Style</h4>
            <p>CSS styles are added directly to the HTML element using the style attribute.</p>
            <p>This method is not recommended, as it can lead to messy code and makes it difficult to maintain and update styles.</p>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            <h4>2. Internal Style</h4>
            <p>CSS rules are placed within a <"style"> element in the <"head"> section of the HTML document. This method is suitable for small projects or single-page websites.</p>

        <p>
            <h4>3. External Style</h4>
            <p>CSS rules are placed in a separate CSS file (e.g., styles.css) and linked to the HTML document using the <"link"> element.</p>
            <p>This method is recommended for larger projects or multi-page websites, as it keeps the styles separate from the HTML, making it easier to maintain and update.</p>
